# LibreSDK - Open FreeStyle Libre

Since there are a dozen of repositories floating around on github trying to decode the contents of a FreeStyle Libre. 
Therefore, with each of them using another approach the idea came to standardize them all into one SDK (Software Development Kit).
The ultimate goal of this to open up the FreeStyle Libre in a way that every developer can easily create his own application without reinventing the wheel everytime.
This will hopefully result into a lot of open-source projects with the intention to make the life of T1D patients easier. 

We are NOT waiting!
